Distinguishing between different time series models (such as LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA, and exponential smoothing models) based solely on the input time series dataset can be challenging. However, there are certain characteristics or features of the data that can provide hints about which model might be suitable:

Trend and Seasonality:

LSTM: Can capture complex, non-linear trends and seasonal patterns.
Prophet: Designed to model time series with strong seasonal patterns and multiple seasonalities.
ARIMA: Handles linear trends and seasonal patterns.
Exponential Smoothing (exps): Suitable for data with a constant or changing trend, and can capture some seasonal patterns.
Noise Level:

LSTM: Can handle data with higher noise levels due to its ability to model complex relationships.
ARIMA: Effective for data with moderate noise levels.
Exponential Smoothing (exps): Works well for data with lower noise levels.
Temporal Dependencies:

LSTM: Can capture long-term temporal dependencies.
ARIMA: Models temporal dependencies using autoregressive and moving average terms.
Prophet: Accounts for changes in trends and seasonalities over time.
Exponential Smoothing (exps): Models temporal dependencies based on previous observations.
Data Stationarity:

LSTM: Doesn't require data to be stationary but may benefit from preprocessing.
ARIMA: Requires the data to be stationary or made stationary through differencing.
Exponential Smoothing (exps): Typically works well with non-stationary data.
Model Complexity:

LSTM: Complex model with a large number of parameters, suitable for complex data patterns.
ARIMA: Relatively simpler model compared to LSTM but still effective for many time series patterns.
Prophet: Provides a balance between simplicity and effectiveness for time series with strong seasonalities and holiday effects.
Exponential Smoothing (exps): Simple and efficient, especially for forecasting with smoothing parameters.
Data Size and Availability:

For smaller datasets or when computational resources are limited, simpler models like ARIMA or exponential smoothing may be preferred.
Historical Data Behavior:

Understanding how the time series has behaved historically (e.g., smooth or erratic) can guide the choice of model.
